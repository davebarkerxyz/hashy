# Hashy: fast recursive file hashing

Hashy generates md5 hashes of directory trees using multiple threads for pretty decent performance.

## üìã Features

- Lightweight (a couple of hundred lines of Go code)
- Single binary
- Multi-threaded for better performance
- Exclude portions of the directory tree

## Building hashy

### The quick way 

To get the latest version from Github:

- [Install the Go compiler](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Download, compile and install hashy in one step: `go install github.com/davebarkerxyz/hashy@latest`


### The long way

```
git clone https://github.com/davebarkerxyz/hashy
cd hashy
go build ./...
go install
```

### Pre-built binaries

You can download the latest release builds from [Releases](https://github.com/davebarkerxyz/hashy/releases).

*Note that while cross-compiled builds are created for multiple platform and architecture combinations, only darwin/arm64 (MacOS Apple Silicon) and linux/arm64 (Linux 64-bit ARM) are actively tested.*

## üßê Why did I build this?

I was looking for an easy way to verify a backup of my (huge) MacOS home directory to make sure that the backups remained consistent when moving between media (replacing failing backups HDDs with SSDs). `find` piped to `md5` (or `md5sum` on Linux) was *ok*, but excluding paths without descending into or statting them was tricky and the syntax was opaque, to say the least.

It was also an excuse to sharpen my Go skills. There's no promise the Go code here is *pretty*, but it is simple. Mostly, hashy is just for me, but someone else might find it useful.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

```
dave@purah hashy % hashy -h
Recursively hash every file in supplied path, writing the hash to stdout.

Usage: hashy [-hv] [-a algorithm] [-w number] [-x path1,path2] path

-a,algorithm algorithm    hash algorithm: md5, sha1, sha256, sha512 (default: md5)
-debug                    enable debug output
-h                        show this help message
-show-errors              show normally-suppressed errors (like skipping non-regular files)
-v,-version               show version number
-w,-workers number        number of workers (default: 10)
-x,exclude path1,path1    comma-separated list of directories to exclude

Example: hashy -a sha256 -x $HOME/Library,$HOME/.lima ~/
```

To hash your home directory and exclude the *Library* and *.lima* subdirectories:

```
hashy ~/ -exclude $HOME/Library,$HOME/.lima
```

To run with only a single worker:

```
hashy ~/ -workers 1
```

You can see the full usage information with `hashy -h`

## üìº Demo

Hashing 1.1GB across approx 36,400 files in around 1.6s:

## üêÜ Performance

On my M1 MacBook Pro 14 (2021) internal SSD, hashing my 278GB home directory under the default configuration (workers = GOMAXPROCS, in my case that was 10), it took 6m57s.

Setting workers to 1 (single-threading the hashing, but leaving the main thread to handle setup and cleanup), hashing the same tree took 16m02s.

*Note: testing wasn't under any sort of controlled conditions (the MacBook is my daily driver and had been running for a few hours with several applications running during testing, and the files in my home directory vary from a few bytes to tens of gigabytes), but it's probably representative of performance under typical use.*

Performance could have been further improved if I could avoid `stat`ing every file before opening, but this was unavoidable as opening a named pipe causes `os.Open()` to block and never return, blocking a goroutine until you kill the process. The only way we can avoid that is by `stat`ing each file and making sure we only open regular files.

## üñäÔ∏è Notes

Symlinks are ignored and not followed. Non-regular files (named pipes, etc) are also ignored.

You should use `$HOME` when specifying multiple exclude directories, e.g. `hashy ~/ -exclude $HOME/Library,$HOME/.lima` as your shell will probably not expand tildes mid-string in the comma separated exclude list e.g. `hashy ~/ -exclude ~/Library,~/.lima`.
